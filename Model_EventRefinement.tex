\noindent\textbf{Event Refinement.}
\label{refinement}
%Above methods could help us detect trending events and construct storylines.
%We further introduce our method to refine these results.
The refinement procedures are responsible for spam filtering and context enrichment.
%There are a lot of noises, e.g. ads, gossips of celebrities and daily life on the social network.
Based on the method \cite{liu2013many}, we first remove spam accounts from our data crawler,
who are either constantly publishing ads content or actually manipulated by intelligent software for propaganda purposes.
We apply a 3-class Naive Bayes classifier to detected trending events which differentiates news, ads and widsom words,
where the latter two are major types of spam information on Weibo.
We train the classifier with manually labeled data based on features of content, users and temporal information.
%This meets semantic requirement (4).
We further extract the location of the detected events using a location vocabulary
and find out the candidates of events with \emph{ICTCLAS}\footnote{http://ictclas.nlpir.org/}, including nouns, people and organizations etc.
