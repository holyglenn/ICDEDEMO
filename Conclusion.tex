
\section{Conclusions}
We have demonstrated \ring, a real-time emerging event monitoring system over microblog platforms, 
that integrates our efforts on both research and development of emerging event monitoring.
\ring is able to detect emerging events, build hierarchical sub-event correlations, trace event evolutions, and support event and text queries.
%Various optimization techniques have been developed to support efficient data processing and query.
Further, \ring's infrastructure is equipped with an optimized full-text search engine and a distributed processing engine.
%To our best knowledge, \ring outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from both the semantic and systematic perspective.
The system present its advantages over existing systems~\cite{mathioudakis2010twittermonitor,xie2014clear, schubert2014signitrend} from both technical and system perspectives.
