We demonstrate \ring, a \un{r}eal-t\un{i}me emerging eve\un{n}t monitorin\un{g} system over microblog platforms
that integrates our efforts from both event monitoring research and system research.
\ring can detect emerging events, build hierarchical sub-event correlation, trace event evolution and support queries to events and texts.
%Various optimization techniques have been developed to support efficient data processing and query.
\ring's infrastructure is equipped with optimized full-text search engine and distributed processing engine.
%To our best knowledge, \ring outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from both the semantic and systematic perspective.
The system present advantages over existing systems~\cite{xie2014clear, schubert2014signitrend, mathioudakis2010twittermonitor} from both the semantic and system perspective.
