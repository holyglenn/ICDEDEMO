
\section{Conclusions}
We demonstrate \ring, a real-time emerging event monitoring system over microblog platforms
that integrates our efforts on both research and development of emerging event monitoring.
\ring can detect emerging events, build hierarchical sub-event correlations, trace event evolution, and support event and text queries.
%Various optimization techniques have been developed to support efficient data processing and query.
\ring's infrastructure is equipped with an optimized full-text search engine and distributed processing engine.
%To our best knowledge, \ring outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from both the semantic and systematic perspective.
The system present advantages over existing systems~\cite{mathioudakis2010twittermonitor,xie2014clear, schubert2014signitrend} from both technical and system perspectives.
